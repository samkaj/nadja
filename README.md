# Nadja

Nadja generates playlists for your Spotify account based on 5 tracks you want to base it on. Adjust the energy and danceability and you're good to go! By consuming the Spotify Web API, Nadja handles auth, fetches songs based on search terms, finds recommendations and creates playlists with those tracks if you accept. Nadja is one of my first TS projects and was done to get a feel for how I like the web dev stack. I did it without a backend to tackle one thing at a time.

## Running
